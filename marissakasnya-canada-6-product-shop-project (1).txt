Hi, I'm Marissa, looking for website help. We currently have a website with Godaddy using their designer, and it's not SEO friendly at all so we need a better and simpler solution. https://oivawireless.com

Can you give me a price or do I just go by what's on the site? 6 products total with 3 images for each product. I really hate the website builder, we need something a bit more exciting. Thanks
n

I can make it quite exciting and fast so that google algorithm likes it.

Linux is faster and can be better optimized for SEO.

Or regular godaddy hosting. Where I would have ftp access to just yo and download files I need. The godaddy hosting doesn‚Äôt even give me FTP access

WIRELESS VIDEO SYSTEMS THAT SIMPLY WORK

Since 2009, Oiva Wirelesst has been creating wireless systems for the law enforcement, drone and industrial markets and most recently for broadcasters. Our success is due to a deep understanding of the wireless environment and a drive to deliver mission critical video for our clients. We continue to redefine the standard, offering frequency agile systems that provide our users the most comprehensive suite of frequency coordination tools available.

Wireless video systems have been around for many years and have evolved from very large, power hungry units to small uncompressed systems. The ability of a system to transmit reliable, clear signals has been dependent on location, RF output power, board design, type of signal format and receiver sensitivity. Effective, reliable systems are usually line of sight, high power, bulky and expensive. Smaller, less expensive systems tend to have a short throw, unable to transmit through obstructions and are generally unreliable.
